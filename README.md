Project with the purpose to practice JavaScript and learn how to connect to a REST API. In this one I used Last FM's API.

Since I have a firm belief that RnB-music makes everything in life better, I wanted to create an RnB-song generator.

The site contains an input field in which you can write a question about anything in life. After doing so, the site serves you a random RnB song from my "loved tracks" on Last FM.

It might be worth mentioning that in this assignment, I wanted to treat myself with an easygoing and playful project in which I would have the time to experiment with ideas, animations and colors. Much needed after weeks of learning new programming concepts. 


### Technologies used:
* [Last FM API](https://www.last.fm/sv/api)
* JavaScript: async / await
* HTML and SASS/CSS
* Google Fonts

### About the Last FM API
[https://www.last.fm/sv/api](https://www.last.fm/sv/api)

The Last FM API allows you to get data about tracks, artists, albums, geographic play statistics, tags, scrobble data from specific users, etc.


### The process
I started out connecting to the API and playing around with different methods, before deciding which idea to go for. I wanted to make something that wasn't already presented the Last FM-site, which most of the statistics already are.

In this assignment I made use of my personal "loved tracks", since I couldn't find a way to filter all my scrobbles on a specific tag. This could probably be more elegantly done.

If I had more time I would love to make the "search function" an _actual_ search function. For example it could look for words in the search term and match it with lyrics in the songs, in order to give you a more relevant song.
